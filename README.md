ESW Solar Bus Stop Project.

The final goal of this project is to provide solar powered heating to bus stops at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. 
The files in the prototype file contain the electrical schematics for a proof of concept test.
The core components of this project are:
solar panel (~12V 4A)
charge controller that can handle that power,
microcontroller to determine when to power on the heat.
Battery (~360 Wh) 

Next Steps:
1. Build troubleshoot prototype circuit.
2. Review design concepts and features.
3. Design actual solar circuit
4. Buy Components
5. Test Circuit
6. Build circuit container
